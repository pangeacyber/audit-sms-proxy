# Pangea SMS Secure Audit Log Example
## An SMS forwarding service that logs messages between two parties and optionally redacts sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) in real-time with Pangea's Redact Rulesets. By publishing conversation hashes to the blockchain you can provide irrefutable evidence of what was said between two parties without actually exposing the contents of the conversation publicly. With Pangeaâ€™s Secure Audit Log SDK, you can deliver the power of the blockchain to your users with a few lines of code.

Refer to the [Secure Audit Log SMS Proxy](https://pangea.cloud/docs/tutorials/sms-proxy/) for details.
